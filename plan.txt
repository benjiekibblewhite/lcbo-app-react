plan:

Have dummy results in data.js
use Axios for Ajax
use bulma

x Option to change address in header
x Option to go back to results in store view
- Copy in header: What does this app do?
x Movement for forms when appear/disappearn
- Loading animations on submit buttons
- suggestions when search result empty - on click, submit search with that suggestion
x turn results into their own components, then render cards inside of that component

- should i be using routing to manage displays? 

User Location Form.jsx
x cities in Array
x text input for address
x onsubmit callback function
	x concatenates address + city + ON
x option to cancel
- can this be a modal that pops up only when needed, rather than being the first thing you see?


x How to remove Component when form submits?
	x with state!!!

Search Input Field.jsx
x  simple text input + submit button
x stores search term in state
x submit calls AJAX
x submit calls function to render Product Cards


Prev/Next buttons
x renders previous/next set of cards from json response
x can share same code - pass storeResults or productResults as "results". Then it's results.pager.previous_page or next_page

ProductCard.jsx
x on click, callback function to show stores with product in stock

StoreCard.jsx
x on click, function to open new tab with google maps walking directions
x add icon
