plan:

Have dummy results in data.js
use Axios for Ajax
use bulma for mockups
can't use bulma without sass! 
Install sass. :-P 



User Location Form.jsx
x cities in Array 
x text input for address 
x onsubmit callback function 
	x concatenates address + city + ON

How to remove Component when form submits? 


Search Input Field.jsx
- simple text input + submit button
- stores search term in state
- submit calls AJAX
- submit renders Product Cards 


Prev/Next buttons
- renders previous/next set of cards from json response


ProductCard.jsx
- on click, callback function to show stores with product in stock

StoreCard.jsx
- on click, callback function to show google maps walking directions
